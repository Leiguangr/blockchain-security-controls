C.10 Risk assessment
--------------
## (a) Risk assessment policy and procedures	

1.	The organization develops, documents, and disseminates to relevant personnel, a risk assessment policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.

2.	The organization develops, documents, and disseminates to relevant personnel, procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and associated risk assessment controls.

3.	The organization reviews and updates the current Risk assessment policy and Risk assessment procedures every 6 months.

## (b) Risk assessment

1.	The organization conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the blockchain and the information it processes, stores, or transmits.

2.	The organization documents risk assessment results.

3.	The organization reviews risk assessment results regularly.

4.	The organization disseminates risk assessment results to relevant personnel.

5.	The organization updates the risk assessment every 1 month or whenever there are significant changes to the blockchain or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the blockchain.

## (c) Vulnerability scanning	

1.	The organization scans for vulnerabilities in the blockchain e.g. (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. 

2.	The organization ensures that when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the blockchain are identified and reported, it:
a.	Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for (i) Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; (2) Formatting checklists and test procedures; and (3) Measuring vulnerability impact.
b.	Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
c.	Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
d.	Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with relevant personnel to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).

3.	The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.

4.	The organization updates the vulnerabilities scanned prior to a new scan and when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.

5.	The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify the breadth and depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).

6.	The organization determines what information about the blockchain is discoverable by adversaries and subsequently takes corrective actions.

7.	The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities.

8.	The organization reviews historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in the blockchain has been previously exploited.

9.	The organization correlates the output from vulnerability scanning tools to determine the presence of multi-vulnerability/multi-hop attack vectors.


## (d) Insider threat program
The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team.

## (e) Contacts with security groups and associations
The organization establishes and institutionalizes contact with selected groups and associations within the security community: (a) to facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational personnel; (b) To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies; and (c) To share current security-related information including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.
Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Security groups and associations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news groups, and/or peer groups of security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select groups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions. 

## (f) Threat awareness program
The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability. This can include, for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that are likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or multilateral.
