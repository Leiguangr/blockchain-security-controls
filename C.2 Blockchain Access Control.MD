C.2 Blockchain Access Control
------------------------------
## (a) Blockchain Access Control Policy and Procedures

1.	The organization develops, documents, and disseminates, to relevant personnel, a blockchain access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.

2.	The organization develops, documents, and disseminates, to relevant personnel, procedures to facilitate the implementation of the blockchain access control policy and associated access controls.

3.	The organization reviews and updates the current Blockchain Access Control Policy and Blockchain Access Control Procedures every month.

## (b) Blockchain Account Management

1.	The organization identifies and selects the following types of blockchain accounts to support organizational missions / business functions: (a) blockchain administrator (b) blockchain manager (c) blockchain processor.

2.	The organization assigns account managers for blockchain accounts.

3.	The organization establishes conditions for group and role membership.

4.	The organization specifies authorized users of the blockchain, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account.

5.	The organization requires approvals by the blockchain administrator for requests to create blockchain accounts;

6.	The organization creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes blockchain accounts in accordance with the Blockchain Access Control Policy and Procedures.

7.	The organization monitors the use of blockchain accounts.

8.	The organization notifies the blockchain administrator (a) when accounts are no longer required; (b) when users are terminated or transferred; and (c) when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;

9.	The organization authorizes access to the blockchain based on: (a) valid access authorization; (b) intended system usage; and (c) other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;

10.	The organization reviews accounts for compliance with blockchain account management requirements every 24 hours. 

11.	The organization establishes a process for reissuing shared / group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.

12.	The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of blockchain accounts.

13.	The organization only permits the use of shared / group accounts that meet organization-defined conditions for establishing shared / group accounts.

14.	The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk immediately on discovery of the risk.

## (c) Blockchain Access Enforcement

1.	The organization enforces approved authorizations for logical access to the blockchain in accordance with applicable blockchain access control policies.

2.	The organization enforces dual authorization for all actions.

3.	The blockchain prevents access to blockchain parameters and specified cryptographic keys except during secure, non-operable system states.

4.	The blockchain does not release information outside of the established system boundary.

## (d) Information Flow Enforcement

1.	The organization enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the blockchain and between interconnected systems based on  organization-defined information flow control policies.

2.	The blockchain prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by decrypting the information, blocking the flow of the encrypted information and / or by terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information.

3.	The blockchain enforces organization-defined limitations on embedding data types within other data types.

4.	The blockchain enforces information flow control based on organization-defined metadata.

5.	The blockchain uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by organization, system, application and / or individual] for information transfer.

6.	The blockchain binds security attributes to information using organization-defined binding techniques to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.

7.	The blockchain provides access from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any information flow between the different security domains.

## (e) Least Privilege

1.	The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users), which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.

2.	The organization explicitly authorizes access to blockchain parameters, cryptographic keys. 

3.	The organization prohibits privileged access to the blockchain by non-organizational users.

4.	The organization reviews daily the privileges assigned to blockchain administrators, managers and processors to validate the need for such privileges; and reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission/business needs.

## (f) Permitted actions without identification or authentication

1.	The organization identifies actions that can be performed on the blockchain without identification or authentication consistent with organizational missions / business functions.

2.	The organization documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the blockchain, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.

## (g) Remote Access

1.	The organization establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration / connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed.

2.	The organization authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

3.	The blockchain implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

4.	The organization ensures that users protect information about remote access mechanisms from unauthorized use and disclosure.

## (g) Wireless Access

1.	The organization establishes usage restrictions, configuration / connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access.

2.	The organization authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

3.	The blockchain protects wireless access to the system using encryption  and authentication of users & devices.

## (h) Access control for mobile devices

1.	The organization establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices.

2.	The organization authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.

3.	The organization prohibits the use of unclassified mobile devices unless specifically permitted by the authorizing official.

4.	The organization employs container encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on organization-defined mobile devices.

## (i) Use of external information systems

1.	The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to access the blockchain from external information systems.

2.	The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access the blockchain only when the organization verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified in the organizationâ€™s information security policy and security plan.

3.	The organization restricts / prohibits the use of portable storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems.
