4.	The organization configures the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in accordance with recovery time and recovery point objectives. 

5.	The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) and outlines explicit mitigation actions (for example: (i) duplicating backup information at other alternate storage sites if access problems occur at originally designated alternate sites; or (ii) planning for physical access to retrieve backup information if electronic accessibility to the alternate site is disrupted).
