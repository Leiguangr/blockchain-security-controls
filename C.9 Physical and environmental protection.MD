7.	The organization restricts unescorted access to the facility where the blockchain resides to personnel with (a) security clearances for all information contained within the blockchain; (b) formal access authorizations for all information contained within the blockchain; (c) need for access to all information contained within the blockchain.

8.	The organization ensures that individuals lacking sufficient security clearances, access approvals, or need to know, are escorted by individuals with appropriate credentials.

## (c) Physical access control

1.
